<P><B>Part I</B></P>
<P>In this part of the exercise we will interface a 7-segment LED display to 
port 0.The schematic for the hardware is given below. All resistors are about 
360 ohms. Be sure to pay attention to details such as the wire colors and 
orientation of the plug-in connectors.</P>
<P><IMG height=391 src="Interfacing LED Display_files/parall2.gif" width=729

<P>Write a program to write random HEX numbers to the LED whenever the 
pushbutton switch is pressed.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>When the pushbutton is pressed, read the value of a running timer to 
  obtain the random value. (You will need to turn one of the timers on) 
  <LI>Convert the least significant nibble of the value to the corresponding 
  7-segment value. (A subroutine should be used for this). Note that the LED 
  segments are ACTIVE LOW because a common anode display is used. 
  <LI>Send the converted value to port 0. (Don't forget to configure port 0 as 
  an output, and enable the crossbar switch). </LI></UL>
<P>Run the program to the beginning of the subroutine (over and over) and ensure 
that the value you are reading from the timer is the value that is being 
displayed.</P>
<P><B>Part II</B></P>
<P>In the part of the exercise we are going to combine the temperature sensor 
program and a modified version of your display code. The final program should 
continuously display the least significant nibble of the most significant byte 
of the temperature code (read from ADC0). Note that the ADC0 is set for left 
justified data. </P>

<P align=left><B>Report</B></P>
<P align=left>Write a lab report that documents the exercises completed in this 
session. You may refer to the web pages for procedure details, but do give an 
overview of the procedure. Focus on the results and the concepts learned. </P>
