Transistor-based switching circuitry for 68HC1x Interfacing:</B><BR>(Seat of the 
pants engineering)<BR><BR><BR>This page will take you through several practical 
design problems illustrating the design of simple transistor circuits used to 
allow digital 68HC1x outputs to control high current devices such as LEDs, relay 
coils, motors etc.. In these discussions, we will primarily dwell on NPN bipolar 
transistors, although PNP and MOSFET transistors will also be 
discussed.<BR><BR><B>Starting point:</B> Don't expect the 68HC1x outputs to 
source/sink loads of more than about 1mA. To do so may well result in eventual 
failure of the 68HC1x port output circuitry. We will first look at a relatively 
low current application (driving an LED or opto-isolator input), and discuss how 
to size various resistors and to choose suitable transistors for buffering the 
current. The following figure displays two common methods of buffering a 
microcontroller output to enable driving of a high current load. Note that the 
circuit shown in (b.) is crossed out. Although this circuit uses fewer 
components (1 less resistor), it does not assure protection of the 68HC1x. 
Should the collector-to-base junction of the transistor breakdown (e.g. due to a 
large back EMF spike, should the load be an inductive motor instead of an LED, 
or due to transistor failure due to a short circuit of the load etc.), the 
output of the 68HC1x could be destroyed. The base resistor (R<SUB>b</SUB>) of 
figure a.) assures effective isolation against such a catastrophe. <BR><IMG

outputs.<BR><BR>Now lets talk about "seat of the pants" engineering. We will 
commonly use wise "practical" practices such as derating specified component 
values in order to assure the long term reliability of the circuit. Consider the 
following specifications: LED from Radio 
Shack:<BR>(I<SUB>LED</SUB>)<SUB>max</SUB> = 20mA (we'll derate this to 
10mA).<BR>(V<SUB>LED</SUB>)<SUB>forward</SUB> = 1.7V .<BR><BR>2N2222 General 
Purpose (Low Power) Transistor from Radio Shack<BR>Case style (TO-92 plastic 
case -- low power!)<BR>Max. power dissapation ~ 500mW --- definitely derate this 
to, say, 250mW (to be safe)<BR>I<SUB>c</SUB> max ~ 100mA -- derate to 
67mA.<BR>Breakdown voltage- collector to emitter ~ 40V --&gt; shouldn't be a 
problem as we're only using 5V !<BR><BR>When the transistor is off - it 
dissapates no power. When the transistor is on (assume it's in saturation) then 
P<SUB>D</SUB> = (V<SUB>CE</SUB>)<SUB>sat</SUB> x I<SUB>C</SUB> ~ 0.2V x 10mA = 
2mW.<BR>Since 2mW &lt;&lt; 250mW, power dissapation is obviously not an 
issue.<BR><BR>Calculating a value for R<SUB>C</SUB>: Use Ohm's law -- R = 
V/I.<BR>V<SUB>Rc</SUB> = 5V - (V)<SUB>LED</SUB> - (V<SUB>CE</SUB>)<SUB>sat</SUB> 
~ 5V - 1.7V - 0.2V ~ 3.1V .<BR>Now choose R<SUB>C</SUB> = 3.1V/10mA ~ 330 Ohms 
(closest standard resistor value). <BR><BR>Calculate a value for 
R<SUB>B</SUB>:<BR>Although h<SUB>fe</SUB> is advertised to be on the order of 
100 for the 2N2222 or 2N3904, this current gain tends to drop significantly when 
I<SUB>c</SUB> is large (i.e. when the transistor is conducting large collector 
current) or when the transistor is well within the saturation region. Thus, in 
calculating R<SUB>B</SUB> we will use h<SUB>fe</SUB> = 100, then to be certain 
we drive the transistor hard into saturation, we will reduce R<SUB>B</SUB> to 
1/3 of the previously calculated value. To assure good isolation, however, we 
will not reduce R<SUB>B</SUB> below a value of 2.2kohm.<BR><BR>Thus, 
I<SUB>B</SUB> = I<SUB>C</SUB> / h<SUB>fe</SUB> ==&gt; I<SUB>B</SUB> ~ 10mA/100 = 
0.1mA. Now we calculate the voltage across R<SUB>B</SUB> as V<SUB>h</SUB>(68HC1x 
pin) - V<SUB>BE</SUB>. The 68HC1x output high voltage [V<SUB>h</SUB>(68HC1x) ], 
(under load - sourcing about 0.1 mA), I would guess to be about 4.5V. One could 
actually look this up in the Motorola spec sheets, but I'm sure this guess will 
get the job done for our purposes. Thus the voltage across R<SUB>B</SUB> ~ 
4.5V-0.7V ~ 3.8V. Thus by ohm's law, R<SUB>B</SUB> = 3.8V/0.1mA = 38kohms. To 
assure that we drive the transistor hard into saturation, we divide this value 
by three, and use an actual value of:<BR>R<SUB>B</SUB> ~ 10 kohms. <BR>This will 
still provide good isolation of the 68HC1x pin should the collector-to-base 
junction of the transistor breakdown. {Imagine that the junction did break down 
while the 68HC1x was in the "low" state (V<SUB>low</SUB> approaches 0 volts)-- 
(68HC11 output low voltage). Then R<SUB>B</SUB> would have as much as 5 volts 
across it, but using a minimum level of R<SUB>B</SUB> = 2.2k would limit the pin 
current to about 2.25 mA, which is safely below the "absolute maximum" 10mA 
rating published in the Motorola 68HC1x specifications.}<BR><BR>Now the prudent 
thing would be to prototype the circuit, and actually measure pertinent voltages 
and currents, and adjust values if necessary! For example, if we have the LED 
turned on, the voltage across the transistors collector-to-emitter should be 
less than 0.2 Volts. If not, we would make R<SUB>B</SUB> smaller and see if the 
collector-to-emitter voltage drops. Thus we would experimentally assure that the 
transistor goes well into the saturation mode.<BR><BR><BR>
<HR align=left width="50%" color=red SIZE=6>
<B>Design Example for a Higher Power Load</B><BR><BR>Let's say we need to drive 
a 5V relay coil that pulls 150mA. The transistor, in saturation, would have to 
dissapate as much as V<SUB>CE</SUB> (sat) x I<SUB>C</SUB> ~ 0.2V x 150mA = 30mW. 
The 2N2222 or 2N3904 can certainly handle this, however the 150mA exceeds their 
maximum specified collector current of ~90mA. Thus we need a higher power 
transistor. We also note, that with a collector current of 150mA, even with an 
h<SUB>fe</SUB> of 100, the 68HC1x pin would have to source 1.5mA of current, 
which is too much. A good solution is to consider a "Darlington pair" 
transistor[such as the TIP120 - available at Radio Shack] - (which has an 
"effective" h<SUB>fe</SUB> of well over 1000! Another effective solution is to 
use an "N-channel" MOSFET enhancement-mode transistor as a replacement for the 
NPN transistor. [Even though a MOSFET draws no steady state current from the 
68HC1x output pin, its still prudent to use a resistor between the 68HC1x output 
pin and the "gate" of the MOSFET, should the Drain-to-gate junction of the 
MOSFET break down]. The TIP120, e.g., also comes in a TO-5 package which 
contains a large metal heat sink tab. If a heatsink is attached, the TIP120 is 
capable of disspating <B>several watts</B> of power! Thus either a TIP120 or 
power MOSFET (in a TO-5 package) is a good choice for switching high 
power/current loads. The figure below illustrates use of a TIP120 darlington 
transistor to switch the 150mA relay coil. Note that in addition to the "free- 
wheeling" diode - absolutely essential when driving any sort of inductive load, 
we have also placed a small capacitor (0.1 microfarads) across the coil. The 
capacitor helps absorb the initial back EMF spike generated, as the diode cannot 
"turn on" instantaneously. Figuring an effective h<SUB>fe</SUB> of 1000, we 
calculate R<SUB>B</SUB> to be as follows:<BR><BR>Since the darlington contains 
two base-emitter junctions in series, the total voltage from base to emitter is 
~ 1.4 volts. Figuring again on V<SUB>h</SUB>(68HC1x) ~ 4.5V, the voltage across 
R<SUB>B</SUB> comes out to 4.5V - 1.4 V ~ 3.1 V. Now figure I<SUB>B</SUB> = 
150mA/1000 = 150 microamps, thus R<SUB>B</SUB> can be as large as 3.1V/150 
microamps = 20kohms. We use a value of, say R<SUB>B</SUB> = 6.8k to assure that 
the transistor is driven hard into saturation. With this large of a base 
resistance, the 68HC1x output is now <B>really well isolated</B> against a 
catastophic breakdown of the transistors collector-to-base junction! Of course, 
if we wanted to feel even better about ourselves, we could also add an 
optoisolator between the 68HC1x output and the transistor base.<BR><BR><IMG

width=413><BR><B>Figure: Darlington transistor circuit for driving a high 
current inductive load.</B><BR><BR>Again, note that we could also replace the 
TIP120 Darlington transistor with a suitable N-channel MOSFET transistor. The 
MOSFET transistors often perform better in such switching applications. Since 
the gate of a MOSFET does not draw any steady state current from the 68HC1x 
output pin, we can generally replace R<SUB>B</SUB> with something like 4.7k or 
6.8k to merely protect the 68HC1x output in the event that the Drain-to-gate 
junction should break down. When designing using MOSFETS, one would also go thru 
the above procedures for checking for power dissapation. MOSFETs are usually 
specified with a "maximum channel resistance" as (R<SUB>on</SUB>)<SUB>max</SUB>, 
thus one could calculate the maximum MOSFET power disspation as I<SUB>D</SUB>^2 
x (R<SUB>on</SUB>)<SUB>max</SUB>, and make sure that this is well under the 
maximum rated power disspation. If driving, say, an LED, the resistor placed in 
series with the LED (for the purpose of limiting the LED current) would also be 
calculated as was done above.<BR><BR>Finally we show other circuits below. In 
part a.) we have replaced the NPN bipolar transistor with an N-channel 
enhancement MOSFET (avail. @ Radio Shack - the IFR510 power mosfet in TO-220 
package). Here, when the gate-to-source voltage exceeds the V<SUB>GS</SUB> 
threshold voltage, the MOSFET turns on. Although this threshold voltage varies 
from one transistor to the next, it is typically around 2 - 4V, and the 68HC1x 
output pins hopefully will generally have no problem switching the MOSFET on. 
Often, however, some MOSFETS will have a higher Gate-to-source threshold 
voltage, and the 68HC1x will not be able to turn the MOSFET on fully, in which 
case a substantial voltage drop exists across the Drain-to-Source terminals, and 
the MOSFET ends up "gittin real hot". You will want to check this by turning 
your MOSFET on (while driving a load) and measuring this drain-to-source 
voltage. If the problem persists, you may need to find MOSFETS with a lower 
V<SUB>GS</SUB> threshold, or take other measures to raise the applied 
Gate-to-source voltage.<BR><BR>The configurations shown in b.) and c.) below 
differ in that they use PNP and P-channel MOSFET (enhancement mode) transistors, 
such that the logic is reversed. That is, the LEDs would be turned on by writing 
a "0" out to the 68HC1x port pin, and would be turned off by writing out a 
"1".<BR><BR><IMG height=326
